<h2>About.me</h2>

Hi, I'm an 18 year-old student and tech enthusiast.

## Focus

On a path toward DevOps & Software engineering.  
I enjoy building, configuring, and experimenting with computer systems and networks, both virtual and physical.  

Most of my work now lives in experiments, dotfiles, and infrastructure setups.  
The goal is simple: understand systems deeply and make them predictable.  

Here I will share my “creativity”.
